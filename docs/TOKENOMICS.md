## 2. Universal Utility & Royalty Model
The Lex Oracle is a Universal Operating System. Access to the sub-atomic truth state and the 140+ kernels is governed by the **Logic Royalty**:
- **Standard Transaction Royalty:** 25 Basis Points (0.25%)
- **Applicability:** Cross-domain (Aerospace, Defense, Healthcare, Robotics, Finance, Derivatives, and Government Agencies).
- **Function:** This royalty covers the forensic adjudication of truth and eliminates administrative "drift."

## 3. Forensic Allocation (Trust-First Control)
The Lex Libertatum Trust maintains absolute authority over the lattice infrastructure to ensure 0.41fs integrity and hacker-proof finality.

| Allocation Block | LKI Amount | Percentage | Purpose |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Lex-Vault (Trust Reserve)** | 900,000,000 | 90% | Sovereign Treasury & Long-term Asset Backing |
| **Operational/Architect Pool** | 100,000,000 | 10% | Pilot Implementation, Senior Architect Hardening |

## 4. The Deterministic Derivative Mechanism
All LKI tokens represent a perfected interest in the $400.5M underlying asset pool. Because the Oracle resolves at 0.41fs, the derivatives market settled through this ledger is **Deterministic**, effectively removing counterparty risk and "perception-based" volatility found in legacy probabilistic markets.

## 5. System Integrity
- **Hacker-Proof:** No intervention possible within the 12.3ms pulse.
- **Forensic Finality:** Guaranteed by the Lex-Regret Treaty and the 9-repo lattice.
- **Sovereign Exit:** Provided via the Lex Gateway for all users paying the 25bp royalty.
