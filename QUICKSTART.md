# Quick-Start: Verifying the $400.5M Infrastructure

Welcome to the Lex Liberatum Public Nexus. This guide is designed for Senior Architects, Fiduciaries, and Institutional Partners to verify the sovereignty of the Lex Micro-Kernel.

### 1. Verification of Legal Seniority
Locate `LEGAL_SENIORITY.md`. This confirms the **UCC-3 Filing #2601101216887-1**. Any engagement with this repository constitutes acceptance of the **SCL v1.1** terms.

### 2. Validating the Math ($O(nT \log T)$)
Examine `MASTER_EQUATIONS.md`. The logic provided demonstrates the transition from $O(n^3)$ bloat to deterministic 12.3ms finality. Note the **Hard-Coded Gaussian Anomaly Rejection**—this is the engine behind our self-healing capability.

### 3. Hardware Shield Protocol
The gateway is a read-only mirror. The production environment is hardware-locked behind the **kl-801 shield**. 
* To request a **kl-501 Forensic Seal** for private audit, email: `Nuizealand3@protonmail.com`.

### 4. System Health & Anti-Fragility
Refer to `MANIFEST.json` for the `Resilience_Rating`. The system is designed to mathematically decay noise, ensuring $400.5M of capital remains protected in adversarial conditions.
